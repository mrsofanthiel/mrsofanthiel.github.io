        <h1>AAAAXY Hint #2</h1>
        <p>If you are reading this, you have hopefully made it to the hub. All earlier rooms are covered in Help 1.<br>There are 3 pathways to take from the hub room.<br><br>You only need to do 2 of the three paths, but it is recommended you do all three.<br><br>Gray path:<br>Don't go here. (More in sidebar)<br><br>Blue path:<br>Probably the easiest one. It's mostly straightforward.<br>Waterfall: If you are stuck here, pay attention to the drains.<br>Silver City: Go up, and explore the bounce pads.<br>9 Boxes: The exit is on the far end of the room, in the back of the box on the far end of the entrance. Use the bounce pad before the last row to get either on the middle box or the top one. If you are on top, jump down to the middle one. Once you are there, do a wraparound to follow the arrows inside.<br>Kings Cross: Either git gud, or find the fading platforms next to the note when you enter this room. Your goal is to go up. Underneath Train 2 is a bounce pad you can take all the way to 8. For 9-11, pay attention to the fact that there is 3 trains on one side, and towards the glass, a fourth train is unaccounted for.<br><br>White path:<br>The strip: There is a box that will assist you into the correct hole. There is no other indicator.<br>There are 2 pathways here, it does not matter which one you take. I prefer going up, and as such I will cover it here.<br>Mobius Strip: Walk onward untill you spot the arrow.<br>Klein Bottle: Travel onwards untill you go in the hole with the arrow pointing at it. If you fall, just land on one of the interior platforms and keep going. Everytime you fall, the room will mirror. It does not matter what orientation you leave the room in.<br>Projective Plane: Jump to the first plaform, then you will see the arrow points to the hole underneath the way you came out of. Go there. Attempt to avoid travelling horizontally through the plane, just stay in your vertical collum or things will get weird.<br>Sphere: The exact same thing, but falling sucks more.<br>House with two rooms: Entering through the front door is boring. Go back outside and look for bounce pads.</p>
