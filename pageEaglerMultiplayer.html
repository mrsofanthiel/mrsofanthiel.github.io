        <h1>How to play EaglerCraft with Multiplayer</h1>
        <p>The default eagler relays appear to be disfunctional, which woudn't suprise me. To use a working relay, follow these steps:<br><br>1. Go into Multiplayer when EaglerCraft loads<br>2. In the top right of the screen, it should say "Network options." Click it.<br>3. Click "Add Relay."<br>4. Enter this in the top box:<br>wss://eaglerrelay.glitch.me/<br>5. Name it whatever (in the second box), this will be overwritten when you press ok anyway.<br>6. Change the "Primary Relay" option to "Yes."<br>7. Click "Ok."<br>8. Click "Done."<br><br>After this (and refreshing the server list), you should see servers appear in the server list. Feel free to join any of them.<br>Note: If you want to play with your friends, you will need to be on different Wi-Fi networks. It seems to not like people joining each other from the same network, but if you join some rando's server, you can play with each other. You can start a server by opening a world to LAN, which despite what it claims, makes it publicly accessible to an unlimited player count. (TODO: Check accuracy of statement)<br><br>Have fun!</p>
