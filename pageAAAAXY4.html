        <h1>AAAAXY Hint #3</h1>
        <p>If you have gone down a single path, then you have one item. If you have gone down 2, you can beat the game. If you have gone down 3, your set. If you have not found the anti-hub, keep looking. You need to go there.<br><br>Cleats: Ride the platform up untill you get to the shelf with the arrow pointing to the green room. Follow the arrow to get to the Anti-Hub, or go to the blue room to see the hub again.<br><br>Coil: Push the platform untill it hits the button, then step up the blue blocks. Then push those platforms to your pleasure. Go down the path with the diagram of a loaded truck to go to the Anti-Hub, or go the other way to get back to the hub. I would advise using this path to go to the Anti-Hub without grabbing the Gloves first. This path is longer than specified, and the dark blue room essentially requires cheese that uses the gloves, or pain.<br>Gloves: Push the button by grabbing the platform and climb the blue blocks to get up. Use your grabby powers to proceed, then in the next room jump on the platforms to go to the Anti-Hub, or go straight to go back to the hub.<br><br>Welcome to the Anti-Hub. There are once again three paths here. Each path requires 2 items, and all of the paths lead to the Remote, and the item that the path doesn't require.<br><br>Butterfly effect (Uses Gloves and Cleats): Don't go this way, because one of the rooms down the line requires an immense skill in the game I don't have yet.<br><br>The Wide Gap (Uses Coil and Cleats): Consider this path impossible on mobile. You will basically need a keyboard to pass it, even though the rooms after it are really fun.<br><br>Pushing onwards (Uses Gloves and Coil, cleats strongly advised): This is the way 90 percent of people should go. Having the cleats makes this a cakewalk. In the first room, use your gloves and coil to push the buttons and let you up. ooorrrr If you have cleats, ride the platform up lol. Next room is confusing, at the end there is a way to get an extra platform you need to open the door, which means you run through this place twice. ooorrrr You can use the cleats to take a platform from an earlier section and completly skip the part where you do it twice. In the tower of impossible, you have to do a lot of platforming where your grab is limited and your coil is too. ooorrrr You can just use the cleats and ride the platform up, making sure that the obstacles despawn.</p>
