        <p>So you are going to the gray rooms.<br><br>Hilbert's Dotel: Go enjoy the loop, then if you have gone far enough in, the entrance will change.<br>Shepard Tone: You MUST play the notes: E, C, E, D in that order, or else you will become very familliar with the backspace/escape key. The first note you land on doesn't count (This will hopefully be D, and will let you walk to E for free), and a note counts if you jump onto it without getting in the hitbox of another one. You know if you are in the hitbox if the key you are standing on is darker than the rest. You may need to retry this room a lot.<br>Axiom of "Choiche": Carl reference!!11!!1!!	Jokes aside, just go untill you hit a note, then go back.<br>The rest of this path is mostly trivial.<br>Turtle room: Jump on one of the bounce pads, then touch the orb the second turtle holds.<br>Rover: :)<br></p>
